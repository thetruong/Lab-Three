# Herein Lies The Global Styles

All global styles (written using the [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) style language) shall be stored in this folder.

Optionally, instead of creating new `.less` files, you may directly modify the `main.less`. Just be sure to *only* add your LESS code where indicated.

For "library" code, you may add them to a new folder. This way, those code will not be copied into the build folder.
